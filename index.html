            Here is what customers have to say:
            
            - **Nick S.** says: "Boba is alright I guess. The price is a bit off-putting as it is around $7-9 a drink, which is normal for Boba nowadays but for the quality of the tea they provide, I feel like it should be a bit cheaper to match other chains. There is also one boba (Dragonfruit) that is around $10, which I didn't think was worth that price.

            The service is alright, they were typically busy when I visited, so they had a lot of orders to take care of. The atmosphere is nice, good study location or hang out place.
            
            The mobile kiosks are placed in an awkward position that makes it hard to get around if there is a big line, but it does make ordering a bit easier.
            
            Overall its a good location for boba in the area."

            - **Kevino C..** raves: "Cute place and convenient location. Staff were very nice and lots of available seating.

            Purple yam bubble milk was not the best tasting. Strawberry bubble milk was good though and the creme brulee foam added a lot of sweetness and creaminess.
              
            Each were about $7 which is a little pricey for its size but the cups were cute. Great boba place."

            Here are some Reviews:
            
            -**Scott Danek**Says: "Nice people and tasty bubble tea, but you have about a 50% chance of getting one each time you go.
            
            In my last handful of visits:
            
            - Put in an order online. When picking up they were out of large straws for boba and said they would have more in a few minutes. 
            
            45 minutes later there were still no straws. Had to drink my tea while the bubbles stayed at the bottom. Bummer.
            
            - Put in an order online during their stated business hours.
            
            Order accepted, card charged. Walked up to the location to find them closed with a locked door, lights off, stools up on tables. No bubble tea. Bummer. 
            
            Fortunately later got refunded.
            
            - Put in an order online. When I showed up there were about 7 customers hanging around, with no one who worked there on location. 
            
            Other customers said the employee had to step out and would be back in about 15 minutes. I guess I should have just made my own tea?

            I want to love this place, but they really need to step up on running a reliable food establishment."

           
            -**Christine Polanco **Shares: "Slow to get my order, but worth the wait. Might be the best bubble tea shop in town.
            
            The assam milk tea was delicious."

            What some customers have to say :

            -**Ivy Eng-Szeto ** says :"6 months ago. Everything my friends and I had were absolutely delicious. 
            
            My friend and I shared a crepe and ice cream. 
            
            The crepe was better than the one I recently had in Queens, NY.  The staff was friendly. 
            
            I highly recommend this place!" 

            
            
            -**Daniel Lopez** says :"Absolute Zero‚Äôs seasonal ice cream flavors were interesting as I was stuck between 3 options but I ended up with the death by chocolate. 

            Tasty but nothing special if I‚Äôm being honest. 

            It didn‚Äôt really justify the long wait in line and long wait for our order to be ready.

            Staff was nice but seemed rushed with the surge of customers that came in.

            Located nicely in front of a park to eat the ice cream on a nice hot day."

            Thoughts of Customers :
            
            -**Mario L** shares: "3 months ago ,Came all the way from New Mexico and have tried bobas in a lot of places.
             
            The drinks here are delicious, flavors are consistent, service is amazing, and they have cute cups! The BEST Boba in Massachusetts!!! 
             
             We are going to miss this place when we return to NM. The owner is the sweetest person and she really cares about her customers." 


             -**Amber T Nguyen** comments:" The best boba/ice cream in the Amherst-Hadley region. 
             
             Amherst has many boba shops but NONE as good in quality as Little Heaven. 
             
             The menu is extensive and the drinks always hit without fail. I would go here every day if I had the funds!!!"

           -**Maya Damiano** shares :" I love the atmosphere here, so modern and the perfect place to sit down and do homework for a few hours! 
           
           The staff are really nice and helpful, even when it‚Äôs crazy busy.
           
           I have tried quite a few drinks and they have all been amazing, but my favorites are the chocolate slush and lavender milk tea. 
           
           I love that you can change the toppings, ice, and sugar levels on drinks to get the perfect combination. 
           
           All around, my new favorite boba place in town "
